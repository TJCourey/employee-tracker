# employee-tracker

## Description

This is an employee database system created using NodeJS and MySQL. This was a good exercise for me as it really solidified my knowledge of working with Node and Inquirer. I had some difficulty with the MySQL syntax and getting lists to populate into my arrays properly, but I really feel like with more practice it will become easier and simpler to grasp.
